# Personal Finance Tracker

## Application Description
This is a Java program designed to keep track of your personal finances. It's primary usage is to show you all your banking information/transactions from a simple GUI without having to go through all the hassle of logging onto online banking platforms. You can input transactions categorized by date, store/vendor, expense category, and account you spent the money from. This will automatically update your running balances in the main menu which can help you with monitoring your expenses. 

## Instructions for End User
At the start of the program, you will be prompted to choose to either run the text based version of the program or the GUI version of the program. Both use the same data so choose whichever you want. If you wish to **add an X to a Y**, then after loading into the main menu, go ahead and click Transactions -> add a transaction. This will then prompt you to enter the information for a new transaction. You then have 3 options to view transactions, **Show all transactions**, **Show all transactions in a specific month/year**, and **Show all transactions under a specific expense category**. To find the graph that shows your monthly spendings by year, start from the main menu, and go ahead and click **Display graph**. You will then be prompted to choose a year in which to view, and a graph will be subsequently displayed. To load past saved information, just simply start the program (in either text or GUI) and follow the instructions on screen prompting you to either load or not load the information. Same goes for saving the information, after you are done using the program, press 5 to quit in the text version or click **Quit** in the GUI and you will be swiftly prompted with save or not save your banking and transaction information.

## Usage

Owning a bank account means that you must take the responsibilty of managing your funds, not overdrafting, and paying your bills on time. This app is designed to make this daunting task easier for you. Your bank balance and transaction history all available within a simple program.

## Personal Interest
Ever since I opened my first bank account and started working at 16, my dad has drilled the importance of financial responsibility into my brain like it was the the virtue of life (objectively it is). So since then, I've been using an Excel sheet to keep track of my finances, but never attempted to transition to an interactive program. This is my chance to my passion into a project that I hope others could also find a use for.
