## Personal Interest
Ever since I opened my first bank account and started working at 16, my dad has drilled the importance of financial responsibility into my brain like it was the the virtue of life (objectively it is). So since then, I've been using an Excel sheet to keep track of my finances, but never attempted to transition to an interactive program. This is my chance to my passion into a project that I hope others could also find a use for.
